Python tools for computational approaches implementing nonlinear analysis techniques for a toggle switch model.
The toggle switch here refers to an engineered biological circuit with two proteins that repress each other.

Following tools available - 
1. Lyapunov stability analysis
2. Input to state stability analysis
3. Numerical solutions using SciPy odeint
4. Bounds to solutions 
5. Solutions dependence on parameters and initial conditions
